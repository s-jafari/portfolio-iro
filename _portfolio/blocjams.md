### Summary  
With omnipresent access to the internet, constant access to music has become normality. The purpose of Blocjams is to manage music libraries and playback online.

### Explanation    
Blocjams is a user application, which allows management of music libraries and online playback. While it is no longer common to purchase or at least carry around physical forms of music such as vinyls or CDs, Blocjams offers users the opportunity to manage their digital copies online in order to access at all times, regardless of their location. At the same time, artist can distribute their music digitally and thereby address the threat of pirate ware.  
As a developer, I helped to create the responsive Blocjams web application using Javascript.

### Problem & Solution   
The task has been to develop a responsive web application, which is able to display a music library in the form of an album overview and access each album in order to play the songs within.

To achieve this, HTML & CSS has been extended by Javascript, using the JQuery library.

### Results  
The result is a basic but functioning responsive web application, which uses placeholder album data for the time being.

### Conclusion  
Blocjams has been my first development project from start to finish. During the development, I have been able to learn the actual use of Javascript and how to use JQuery. Additionally, I have have been able to gather first experience in developing responsive web pages.  
My biggest challange has been to keep an overview of the multiple  different interacting Javascript functions without losing track of what happens when they actually get called. As most of the used code had been provided by Bloc, I found this difficult at times. In my opinion, it is easier for a developer to maintain an overview over the code if it has been written entirely by himself.  
I will be glad though, to use what I learned in future development projects and base my code on the insights from the Blocjams project.
